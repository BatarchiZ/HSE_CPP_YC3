The input file contains the encrypted message text. It contains lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, numbers, punctuation marks («. », «! », «? », «: », « - », «, », < <; », « (», «) »), spaces and line breaks. The size of the input file does not exceed 10,000 bytes. The text contains at least one non-whitespace character. All lines of the input file are no longer than 200 characters. For each character c except spaces and line breaks, print a column of “#” characters, the number of which should be equal to the number of characters c in this text. Under each column write the symbol corresponding to it. Format the histogram so that the lower ends of the bars are on the same line, the first row and the first column are non-empty. Do not separate the bars from each other. Sort the columns in order of increasing character codes.
